<H3>SCOPE</H3>
<P align=justify>Research on event-based systems and publish/subscribe systems 
has recently gained increasing attention. It has been recognized that loosely 
coupled asynchronous communication mechanisms are necessary to build complex 
distributed systems. Comparable mechanisms are already used in existing 
products, including enterprise application integration platforms, enterprise 
resource planning systems, application servers, and database management systems. 
Moreover, event service features have been included in many middleware 
platforms, such as J2EE, CORBA, and COM+. 
<P align=justify>Although these services provide some basic functionality, there 
are still many open problems, ranging from design and integration to scalability 
issues. Technical and algorithmic solutions that increase scalability must be 
supported by solutions providing models of coordination, programming 
abstractions, usage patterns, and data management support. Furthermore, robust 
enterprise solutions will be integrated with legacy systems in heterogeneous 
environments, raising data management and security issues. Future application 
scenarios, including web-based services, support for mobility, and 
location-based services, will stress all of these topics. 
<P align=justify>New requirements for event-based systems, especially high 
availability, auditing and tracking requirements from enterprise application 
integration, have shown the increasing importance of databases in event-based 
computing, especially in large-scale application integration. The need to track 
changing business information reflected in databases has driven the need for 
active database technology and continuous query management in this context. 
<P align=justify>Research on event-based systems and publish/subscribe systems 
is dispersed among different areas of computer science including data 
management, distributed systems, networking, software engineering, and 
programming languages. Moreover event-based concepts are applied in commercial 
software. 
<P align=justify>The objectives of this workshop are to bring together 
participants from academia and industry that work in areas related to 
event-based systems and publish/subscribe systems to discuss problems in 
distributed event management in the context of large-scale applications, 
including, but not limited to, application integration, web server farms, 
network management, data dissemination, location-based services, mobile networks 
and to identify relevant research problems and directions in this emerging 
field. The intend is to keep the meeting highly interactive and encourage 
discussions among participants. 
<P>Suggested topics for research and position papers include, but are not 
limited to: <BR><BR>
<UL>
  <LI>publish/subscribe technology 
  <LI>messaging middleware 
  <LI>continuous query management 
  <LI>active databases and trigger management 
  <LI>integration with databases and storage systems (e.g. active database and 
  transactions processing systems) 
  <LI>relationship to stream-based data management 
  <LI>relationship to tuple spaces 
  <LI>networks of publish/subscribe systems, their applications, and 
  content-based routing 
  <LI>algorithms for distributed event processing (e.g. filtering, routing, 
  composition, ordering) 
  <LI>event notification protocols and delivery mechanisms 
  <LI>efficient use of IP-multicast and publish/subscribe communication 
  techniques 
  <LI>push-based event dissemination mechanisms 
  <LI>fault-tolerant event distribution 
  <LI>event-based systems and peer-to-peer networks 
  <LI>performance issues of distributed subscription and event processing 
  <LI>design, architecture, and engineering of event-based applications 
  <LI>case studies of challenging applications and requirement analysis </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>We explicitly solicit industrial participation, presenting 
experiences with event-based systems, messaging middleware, publish/subscribe 
systems, the use and provision of event models in existing products, and the 
backgrounds of commercially available event-based systems. Industrial papers 
should be indicated as such. <A name=dates></A>

<H3>AUTHOR INFORMATION and SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</H3><A name=submission></A><A 
name=proceedings></A>
<P align=justify>Submitted papers should describe original, unpublished research 
or experience and be no longer than 8 pages and adhere to the <A 
href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html">ACM proceedings 
format</A> (http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html). Templates are 
available for major text processing systems. Papers should start with title, 
authors and affiliations, abstract, and keywords. Papers previously published or 
already being reviewed by another conference are not eligible. Papers should be 
made available <B>electronically in PDF format</B>. <A 
name=submission></A>Please <B>submit</B> your paper by the deadline via email to 
<A href="mailto:jacobsen@eecg.toronto.edu">jacobsen@eecg.toronto.edu</A> 
indicating in the subject line that you are submitting a paper for the DEBS 
Workshop. A submission confirmation will be emailed to you within 72 hours of 
submission. 
<P align=justify>All papers must be written in English and will be reviewed by 
members of the Program Committee. Accepted papers will be included in the online 
proceedings of the workshop published on the workshop web site and the SIGMOD 
DiSC. The publication of revisions of selected papers after the workshop in a 
special issue of a journal is being considered. 
<P align=justify>Some papers may not be selected for presentation, and some may 
be selected for presentation in shorter talks than their paper length would 
otherwise command. We will limit the length of paper presentations and the 
number of papers presented to make sure that there is enough time for 
discussion. At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to attend the 
workshop in order to present the work. 
<P align=justify>The tentative program of the workshop will consist of an 
invited talk, a set of paper presentations and discussions.
